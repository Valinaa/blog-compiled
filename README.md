## Customized Configuration

### Add `tabs` Support

You can use the [plugin](https://vitepress-plugins.sapphi.red/tabs/) provided by the VitePress community. Based on current feedback, it seems that the plugin only supports `ESM` . If necessary, you can modify and use it yourself.

### Theme Personalization

[Config Document](introduction/themeConfig.md) or [Original Author Introduction](https://theme.sugarat.top/).

### Add `Comments` Support

You can use the discussions provided by GitHub, as detailed in the [document](https://giscus.app).

### Other

VitePress is still in a state of continuous development, and open source enthusiasts are welcome to actively participate!
